# DRAFT_HCCC Ethics paper treatment

Introduction
============

This short note proposes an ethics of “Human Computer Interaction”.
By bringing together philosophical sources and existing references to
ethics in HCI, we aim to develop a set of salient ethical guidelines
for researchers and practitioners.  We consider ethics not simply in
terms of abstractions like trolley problems, but with an eye to
concrete applications within in 'hybrid' systems.

Our motivation is that we've clearly entered into a new historical
era, whether we think of it as the anthropocene, the information age,
or indeed the Novacene (Lovelock).  Many of the historically-novel
aspects of our current existence can be seen as the legacy of the
industrial revolution: however computers have played a significant and
increasing role since their introduction.  Whereas there are mature
paradigms for interaction *using* computers (e.g., Wikipedia), the
paradigms of interacting *with* computers (e.g., Cambridge Analytica)
continue to raise problematic issues.  At the same time, there are
many unsolved problems that humans together with computers are working
to address (e.g., climate change)!  To ameliorate the harms and
capitalise on the benefits, we need a way to understand human-computer
interaction ‘at scale’.

Method
======

We survey references to philosophy within computing literature and
references to computing within philosophy, focusing on ethics.  Based
on aligning this material we propose ethical guidelines.

Scope
=====

*Human-computer cocreativity* (HCCC) is a motivating domain. In HCCC,
creativity is attributed to collectives.  Here, we want to look in
more detail at what what humans co-create computational media.  While
our focus is on modern computing machinery, in order to cast a wide
net we think about computers as ‘effective systems’, or even just as
machinery.  Our primary questions:

1.  What should we understand by ‘an ethical use of computer
    technology’?

2.  How can our reflections on HCI and HCCC build a foundation for the
    ethical uses of intelligence?

Our survey will look both philosophical and computing work within the
following thematic areas:
(*§1.0*) Western philosophy and ethics definition.
(*§2.0*) Relating western to nonwestern practices.
(*§3.0*) Phenomenology and being.
(*§4.0*) Embodied cognition, social intelligence, collective intelligence.
(*§5.0*) Reprise: Evolution regarding all of these.

# *§1.0* Western philosophy and ethics definition 
- Classical perspectives on Ethics
- go deep maybe into pre-aristotle
- Aristotelian vs Platonic
- Spinoza: virtue is capacity for action
- Kant and the categorical imperative
- David Hume on the problem of induction
- Maybe talk about the authors that break down cognitivism and agree or not - dualists, functionalists, materialists etc
- “[Creative evolution](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/#CreaEvol)” from Bergson
- **Where do we stop this section** and move to the other more modern stuff?

## Responses in the computing literature
- Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneiderman (using computers to think about ‘creativity’)

# *§2.0* Relating western to nonwestern practices
- “Chaîne opératoire” from André Leroi-Gourhan et al.
- Decolonial theory
- panpsychism, buddhism, animism, ubuntu: all universe is alive and updating materialism - which not necessarily might be eastern but bridge with what doesnt exist

## Responses in the computing literature
- TBA

# *§3.0* Phenomenology and being
- Husserl
- Heidegger
- What is it to be alive?
- preontology
- be careful to connect this - being and everything - with ethics - Wittgenstein (ethics and aesthetics are one and the same)

## Responses in the computing literature
- TBA

# *§4.0* Embodied cognition, social intelligence, collective intelligence 
- Helmholtz, Kant, Freud, Jung...
- contemporary cognitive science
- Peer Production, e.g., [Benkler, Shaw, and Hill](https://mako.cc/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf); Nissenbaum has a paper about peer production and ethics
- What is mind

## Responses in the computing literature
- “Computational Social Creativity”
- “Human-computer co-creativity”
- ==Say more about Anna’s paper here==
- I think Donna Haraway and other feminist thinkers would fit here
- Computational neuroscience: the ‘neural’ paradigm
- “How AI can be a force for good” — distributed agency

# *§5.0* Reprise: Evolution regarding all of these 
- Histories of the evolution of intelligence (sociality & tools being key focal points)
- Theories of evolution, e.g., Baldwin (and later derived work by Hinton and others)
- Maybe survey what is common to all of them? and how do this constraints; maybe add cultural differences and analogies;
- Current research and breakthroughs on cognition and ethical selfawareness; metacognition and world philosophy;
- Evolution of western thought - connections between philosophy and cognitive science.
- Simondon on technology
- [Bernard Stiegler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler#Books_in_English) --- philosophy of technics and other works
- [Peter Sloterdijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sloterdijk#Works_in_English_translation) --- philosophy of the human environment
- James Lovelock --- *Novacene: The coming age of hyperintelligence* --- This is good because of the evolutionary perspective, though his reasoning may be a bit off.

## Responses in the computing literature
- Evolutionary computing
- Metacognition and ethical judgement - (maybe connect to the title here, and bring cognitive psychology to the discussion (behaviour))
- Modelling ethics and cognition
- Predictive Processing and Active Inference (bring embodiment to the discussion here)
- "Ethical AI": Notice that now that computers are involved, the way we think about ethics and so on is likely to change.

# Case studies

We can comment on, e.g.. *Mathematical creativity* and *Logseq and
friends* (Zettlekasten method and second brains).

- Machines Who Think: A Personal Inquiry into the History and Prospects of Artificial Intelligence

## Mathematical creativity

### Section introduction: Objectives

Have we built up enough of a repertoire to do a deep dive on
mathematical creativity?  Do we need to address these points at the
outset?

- What is mathematics? martin heidegger anything learnable as such. Jorge Luís Borges - the map argument;
- The end of cognition and human ability? The limits of reality and the limits of math (e.g. dimensionality)
- Mathematical creativity as an example - and so what in what ways does it actually ramifies

S. Dick\'s paper talks about the role of hybrid systems, which has come
up again in Chess and will likely be prevalent in other fields:

> the character and capacities of computer work and human work depend on
> the nature of human--computer interactions and their mutual enabling
> and/or inhibiting in specific systems.

She talks about a "cultural materialism" in science.

> As will be discussed at length in the next section, one way that
> intuition was imparted to the computer program was as a weighting
> mechanism for privileging certain inference paths over others

Here's how she thinks about AURA in particular

> AURA was not merely a receptacle of prenegotiated social practices
> but, rather, surprised and resisted its users, participating in the
> negotiations that precipitated a change in mathematical thinking and
> problem solving. I hope that historians of mathematics will continue
> to investigate more instances of such negotiation.

## Logseq and friends

Logseq is part of a history of tool evolution that includes Roam
Research, which has been massively capitalized recently

1.  Other relevant tools in the same space include **Org Roam** (FLOSS)

2.  Logseq itself is also FLOSS

The software is linked with a pseudo-ethical method:
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

I previously worked on a paper in this space: Massively distributed
authorship of academic papers

Tomlinson, B., Ross, J., André, P., et al. 2012. Massively distributed
authorship of academic papers. CHI'12 Extended Abstracts on Human
Factors in Computing Systems, ACM, 11--20.

# Discussion

Have we learned anything that's relevant for practice? Maybe here is a
good time to return to some of the debates that look at "creativity"
in a more mainstream sense, e.g., Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneiderman
about creative systems and social inclusion vs exclusion? From the
point of view of "Methods", hopefully we will have clarified at the
start why we think this sort of activity could lead to new insights!

## Related work
Existing books about "creativity and ethics" and "technology and virtues" don't quite cut the mustard

1. "Creativity and Ethics"
2. "Technology and the virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting"
3. "Made by Humans"
4. "Machines that Think"
5. How AI can be a force for good

### Floridi

This seems like an important point: we'll need new (not necessarily
"agential") ways to think about ethics.  It seems useful to apply this
in somewhat more general terms about "intelligent systems" --- or just
"systems with emergent properties"; so, if distributed agents produce
e.g., environmental degradation, that’s not ethical, and the system
as a whole "should" find ways to improve its behaviour. This sort of
thing is thought about in Elinor Ostrom’s economics.

A particular concern of Taddeo & Floridi here seems to be "autonomy"
of AI, and "self-determination" of humans. But in the case of HCI/HCCC
it\'s not totally clear that either of these criteria apply. In HCCC
it\'s much closer to
[anthropotechnics](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2015/09/peter-sloterdijk-anthropotechnics/).

> Humanity learned this lesson the hard way when it did not regulate the

I think it\'s worthwhile to think of these things as **not separate**
from AI issues [Supplementary info](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2018/08/22/361.6404.751.DC1).

Now, at the end, we might draw some conclusions about how "HCI" allows
us to do global research, build projects involving people from around
the world, with rich access to the world's knowledge resources. We
might also have something to say about why Ethical AI is so trendy
right now, and perhaps even speculate a bit about its future!

# Conclusions
Hopefully we can answer these questions:

1.  How can I practically engage with these issues as a computer science researcher?
2.  Tech design and CS thinking: creativity as mirror of ethical principles?
3.  Research Ethics, Practitioner Ethics, relating to other forms of Professional Ethics
4.  Interfaces and establishing relationships between people and things?
5.  How do I relate to knowledge, and with/to the whole body of historical philosophy, science, inquiry, and maybe AI and tech systems?
