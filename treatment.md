Title of the Ethics Paper
============

Introduction
============

This article proposes an ethics of “Human Computer Interaction”. By bringing together philosophical sources and existing references to ethics in HCI, we aim to develop a set of salient ethical guidelines for researchers and practitioners. The development of such a project stems from 1) a need to cement the existing understanding of the use of computer technologies and 2) offer a position that can be used holistically in the use of intelligent systems as members of society.

Our motivation is that we've clearly entered into a new historical
era, whether we think of it as the anthropocene, the information age, or indeed the Novacene (Lovelock).  Many of the historically-novel aspects of our current existence can be seen as the legacy of the industrial revolution: however computers have played a significant and increasing role since their introduction.  Whereas there are mature paradigms for interaction *using* computers (e.g., Wikipedia), the paradigms of interacting *with* computers (e.g., Cambridge Analytica) continue to raise problematic issues.  At the same time, there are many unsolved problems that humans together with computers are working to address (e.g., climate change)!  To ameliorate the harms and capitalise on the benefits, we need a way to understand human-computer interaction ‘at scale’.

Method
======

We survey references to philosophy within computing literature and references to computing within philosophy, focusing on ethics. Based on aligning this material we propose ethical guidelines - which in themselves present a worldview.

Scope
=====

*Human-computer cocreativity* (HCCC) is a motivating domain. In HCCC, creativity is attributed to collectives.  Here, we want to look in more detail at what what humans co-create computational media.  While our focus is on modern computing machinery, in order to cast a wide net we think about computers as ‘effective systems’, or even just as machinery.  Our survey will look both philosophical and computing work within the following thematic areas:

**Why do we need this?** — TBA

Our primary questions:

1.  What should we understand by ‘an ethical use of computer technology’?
2.  How can our reflections on HCI and HCCC build a foundation for the ethical uses of intelligence?

# *1.0* Western philosophy and ethics definition 


Human beings have always been interested in categorizing their behaviour. Classification and criticism, personal and interpersonal, about actions taken towards the world. When this criticism is made, there is no way that it will not be realized subjectively (lens argument), even if it embraces generalization. This recursive feedback to outselves has allowed the analysis and assessment of actions that we deem meaningful - or that others consider significant in us - originating fundamental positions for human understanding from the human. It is not in vain that *ethics* derives from the Greek "ēthikós" (ἠθικός) that means "relating to one's character" - as a relational loop.

This behaviour multiplies. Just as I consider myself, I can imagine the way others consider me, consider them, and develop collaborative processes for all this. Right here comes ethics and the way it will happen in society. For instance:

- **1)** (1785) Kant (Johnson and Cureton 2004) proposed that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a categorical imperative. 
- **2)** (2018) (Noa Naaman-Zauderer) both Descartes and Spinoza thinkers define virtue in terms of activity or freedom, mutatis mutandis, and thus in terms of actual power of acting. Second, I will claim that both Descartes and Spinoza hold a non-consequentialist approach to virtue, by which human actions are evaluated as virtuous or good on the basis of their motivational forces rather than their consequences

We stand on top of Paul and Elder (2003) and define ethics as: **a nondetermined set of concepts, principles and metarules that guide us in determining what behavior (acting towards) helps and/or harms sentient creatures.** Having a fundamental but abstract definition that allows us to develop ethics helps to create a relationship structure.




- Spinoza: virtue is capacity for action
- Kant and the categorical imperative
- Maybe talk about the authors that break down cognitivism and agree or not - dualists, functionalists, materialists etc
- “[Creative evolution](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/#CreaEvol)” from Bergson
- **Where do we stop this section** and move to the other more modern stuff?
- - Utalitarianism - The theory that the “right” moral act is the one that produces the greatest good for society. (connect this with technology)
- Hans Vaihinger - Die Philosophie des Als Ob : Vaihinger comes to view Kant’s doctrine of the essential limits of our cognition through this Schopenhauerian-Darwinian lens: the “limitations of human knowledge,” he says, are “a necessary and natural result of the fact that thought and knowledge are originally only a means, to attain the Life-purpose, so that their actual independence signifies a breaking-away from their original purpose; indeed, by the fact of this breaking-loose, thought is confronted by impossible problems” (PAO xviii). Vaihinger will use this idea to motivate his own fictionalism, and to provide a radical reinterpretation of Kantianism.

# Illustrations

We can comment on, e.g.. *Mathematical creativity* and *Logseq and
friends* (Zettlekasten method and second brains), maybe also *Computational Creativity*.

- use MC as an example on the ethical baggage - ACM community - creativity as AN/1 example
- Machines Who Think: A Personal Inquiry into the History and Prospects of Artificial Intelligence
- Ben Goetzel: 2 mindsets? AGI, Computational Neuroscience
- Luis: program a bot that can teach me math / Nic FFT equation; process philosophy as a generalisation of this? 

## Mathematical creativity

They say that Gauss was the last person who knew all of mathematics.

- David Hume on the problem of induction


### Section introduction: Objectives

Have we built up enough of a repertoire to do a deep dive on
mathematical creativity?  Do we need to address these points at the
outset?

- What is mathematics? martin heidegger anything learnable as such. Jorge Luís Borges - the map argument;
- The end of cognition and human ability? The limits of reality and the limits of math (e.g. dimensionality)
- Mathematical creativity as an example - and so what in what ways does it actually ramifies

S. Dick\'s paper talks about the role of hybrid systems, which has come
up again in Chess and will likely be prevalent in other fields:

> the character and capacities of computer work and human work depend on
> the nature of human--computer interactions and their mutual enabling
> and/or inhibiting in specific systems.

She talks about a "cultural materialism" in science.

> As will be discussed at length in the next section, one way that
> intuition was imparted to the computer program was as a weighting
> mechanism for privileging certain inference paths over others

Here's how she thinks about AURA in particular

> AURA was not merely a receptacle of prenegotiated social practices
> but, rather, surprised and resisted its users, participating in the
> negotiations that precipitated a change in mathematical thinking and
> problem solving. I hope that historians of mathematics will continue
> to investigate more instances of such negotiation.

## Logseq and friends

Logseq is part of a history of tool evolution that includes Roam
Research, which has been massively capitalized recently

1.  Other relevant tools in the same space include **Org Roam** (FLOSS)

2.  Logseq itself is also FLOSS

The software is linked with a pseudo-ethical method:
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

# Discussion

Have we learned anything that's relevant for practice? Maybe here is a good time to return to some of the debates that look at "creativity" in a more mainstream sense, e.g., Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneidermanabout creative systems and social inclusion vs  exclusion? From the point of view of "Methods", hopefully we will have clarified at the start why we think this sort of activity could lead to new insights!

This seems like an important point: we'll need new (not necessarily
"agential") ways to think about ethics.  It seems useful to apply this
in somewhat more general terms about "intelligent systems" --- or just
"systems with emergent properties"; so, if distributed agents produce
e.g., environmental degradation, that’s not ethical, and the system
as a whole "should" find ways to improve its behaviour. This sort of
thing is thought about in Elinor Ostrom’s economics.

A particular concern of Taddeo & Floridi here seems to be "autonomy"
of AI, and "self-determination" of humans. But in the case of HCI/HCCC
it\'s not totally clear that either of these criteria apply. In HCCC
it\'s much closer to
[anthropotechnics](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2015/09/peter-sloterdijk-anthropotechnics/).

I think it\'s worthwhile to think of these things as **not separate**
from AI issues [Supplementary info](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2018/08/22/361.6404.751.DC1).

Now, at the end, we might draw some conclusions about how "HCI" allows
us to do global research, build projects involving people from around
the world, with rich access to the world's knowledge resources. We
might also have something to say about why Ethical AI is so trendy
right now, and perhaps even speculate a bit about its future!

# Conclusions
Hopefully we can answer these questions:

1. **How can I practically engage with these issues as a computer science researcher?**
2. - as a researcher how can I fit inside an ethical framework without disrupting my day-to-day way of work, that in itself guides me as a railway. 
3. **Tech design and CS thinking: creativity as mirror of ethical principles?**
4. **Research Ethics, Practitioner Ethics, relating to other forms of Professional Ethics**
5. **Interfaces and establishing relationships between people and things?**
6. **How do I relate to knowledge, and with/to the whole body of historical philosophy, science, inquiry, and maybe AI and tech systems?**
