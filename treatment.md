Title of the Ethics Paper
============

Introduction
============

This article proposes an ethics of “Human Computer Interaction”. By bringing together philosophical sources and existing references to ethics in HCI, we aim to develop a set of salient ethical guidelines for researchers and practitioners. The development of such a project stems from 1) a need to cement the existing understanding of the use of computer technologies and 2) offer a position that can be used holistically in the use of intelligent systems as members of society.

Our motivation is that we've clearly entered into a new historical era, whether we think of it as the anthropocene, the information age, or indeed the Novacene (Lovelock).  Many of the historically-novel aspects of our current existence can be seen as the legacy of the industrial revolution: however computers have played a significant and increasing role since their introduction.  Whereas there are mature paradigms for interaction *using* computers (e.g., Wikipedia), the paradigms of interacting *with* computers (e.g., Cambridge Analytica) continue to raise problematic issues.  At the same time, there are many unsolved problems that humans together with computers are working to address (e.g., climate change)!  To ameliorate the harms and capitalise on the benefits, we need a way to understand human-computer interaction ‘at scale’.

## Questions
- How are ethics used in systems?
- How do the systems 'react back' on my way of thinking about things?
- And vice versa because of AI? 
  - How do they apply the ethics that I applied, or develop ethics of their own? What is lost in the middle? What would change, what could better?
- What is the narrative? (You need a universal view to appreciate.)

[1] how do I apply ethics in systems - building/using/rebuilding/thinking; 

- how do systems apply ethics in themselves 
- E.g. (Illustration) "Guns, Germs, and Steel" — can this be used to change the world? — This is why this relates to arts & to the ontologically subjective.
  - Guns don't evolve; germs do... but not 'intelligently'.
  - 'Mindset view'; you can view things as organizations or as people?
  - "Ultra Society" — Peter Turchin, societal change, physical violence to the body — but changes can actually predate the violence
  - "Killing of people & being replaced by new ideas"
  - JC: Take a look at the Minnesota tech change econ stuff
- 'Science is making a map of the world'... because of the nature of your reality (you can't validate Marx...) You can understand what he meant, try to apply it to yourself, see how it applies, maybe this can make you a better person. It's not law!  You are your own 'sponge' of the world!
  - Reading text can be as bad for your body as physical violence

## Motivations
- Distributed work
- Social network
- Hacker Manifesto from Mackenzie.. (*written like law*, a government can build from this; it's not ethical to use military drones, except in case X, bla bla bla); vs Daft Punk, disco, dressing as robots.  **ACM**
- How are the ethics actually deployed, e.g., parental controls
- "I am building software in 2025... how do I actually use this taxonomy?"
- This is a type of usability research...
- "You can't validate Foucault, he ruined people's lives, etc." — How do we *use* Foucault.  Philosophy won't give you an answer...
- Archeology of knowledge, laboratory life.  But now everyone has powerful data gathering tools.
- How to communicate culture (the right culture, and well)
- Typical answer: through observation. SN: tends towards a materialist approach. This is the most reliable.
- LA: Hans Weihinger ('aus ald', philosophy of 'as if' — Karl Friston uses this); judge from own lens; Thomas Nagel... view from no-where?

Method
======

We survey references to philosophy within computing literature and references to computing within philosophy, focusing on ethics. Based on aligning this material we propose ethical guidelines - which in themselves present a worldview.

- **Proposal**: Start at Ethics taxonomy.
- What about topics like 'technology addiction'?
- Ethical robots would be beneficial to some but not all...
- Benefits to make people interconnected BUT the implementation can involve gamified behaviour (human-computation as a subset of human-interaction)
- Social interaction; on the tech spaces they are devoid of consideration of power dynamics; or consider using existing power structures to exploit people...?
- Is there an existing survey of ethical approaches to technology??

Scope
=====

*Human-computer cocreativity* (HCCC) is a motivating domain. In HCCC, creativity is attributed to collectives.  Here, we want to look in more detail at what what humans co-create computational media.  While our focus is on modern computing machinery, in order to cast a wide net we think about computers as ‘effective systems’, or even just as machinery.  Our survey will look both philosophical and computing work within the following thematic areas (*Why do we need this?*) **1)**  What should we understand by ‘an ethical use of computer technology’? and **2** How can our reflections on HCI and HCCC build a foundation for the ethical uses of intelligence?


# *1.0* Philosophical foundation for a contemporary ethical practice 
## *1.1* Western philosophy and ethics definition

Human beings have always been interested in categorizing their behaviour. Classification and criticism, personal and interpersonal, about actions taken towards the world. When this criticism is made, there is no way that it will not be realized subjectively (lens argument), even if it embraces generalization. This recursive feedback to outselves has allowed the analysis and assessment of actions that we deem meaningful - or that others consider significant in us - originating fundamental positions for human understanding from the human. It is not in vain that *ethics* derives from the Greek "ēthikós" (ἠθικός) that means "relating to one's character" - as a relational loop.

This behaviour multiplies. Just as I consider myself, I can imagine the way others consider me, consider them, and develop collaborative processes for all this. Right here comes ethics and the way it will happen in society. For instance:

- **1)** *(1785) Kant (Johnson and Cureton 2004) proposed that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a categorical imperative.*
- **2)** *(2018) (Noa Naaman-Zauderer) both Descartes and Spinoza thinkers define virtue in terms of activity or freedom, mutatis mutandis, and thus in terms of actual power of acting. Second, I will claim that both Descartes and Spinoza hold a non-consequentialist approach to virtue, by which human actions are evaluated as virtuous or good on the basis of their motivational forces rather than their consequences.*
- **3** *(2004) (stanford encyclopedia) More specifically then, Bergson’s project in Creative Evolution is to offer a philosophy capable of accounting both for the continuity of all living beings—as creatures—and for the discontinuity implied in the evolutionary quality of this creation.*
- **4** *(2004) (stanford encyclopedia) Hans Vaihinger - Die Philosophie des Als Ob : Vaihinger comes to view Kant’s doctrine of the essential limits of our cognition through this Schopenhauerian-Darwinian lens: the “limitations of human knowledge,” he says, are “a necessary and natural result of the fact that thought and knowledge are originally only a means, to attain the Life-purpose, so that their actual independence signifies a breaking-away from their original purpose; indeed, by the fact of this breaking-loose, thought is confronted by impossible problems” (PAO xviii). Vaihinger will use this idea to motivate his own fictionalism, and to provide a radical reinterpretation of Kantianism.*
- [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/ ](/xZCXvatGRw2CA5FwoBjYIQ)


We stand on top of Paul and Elder (2003) and define ethics as: **a nondetermined set of concepts, principles and metarules that guide us in determining what behavior (acting towards) helps and/or harms sentient creatures.** Having a fundamental but abstract definition that allows us to develop ethics helps to create a relationship structure.

### *1.1.1* Responses in computing literature

These days, given the transmutation of information and increased reception of things around us, technology can even help us to revive and rethink the way these thoughts affect us culturally. For example the work of Kantosalo and Schneiderman: using computers to help us "think" about creativity. (Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneiderman (using computers to think about ‘creativity’))

## *1.2* Holistic views of philosophy 

Philosophy is inherent in the complexity and uniqueness of each culture. When applied from a broad point of view and not only focused on the human, it can conquer and integrate as its baggage other types of entities such as artificial intelligences or non-human organisms. As is the example of panpsychism (Seager 2006), where it is common to have a naturalistic account of the world, for
only from the point of view of some such account
can the issue of mind’s place within the natural
world arise. 

Even the philosophy of mind has in itself a position. Not only as a philosophy, but as a starting point for philosophy to begin. There is a beginning that points to a vision in which all the positions taken before that thought make sense. When using positions that are global in terms of beings that exist, an ethical framework forces us to consider computers as *creatures*. 


### *1.2.1* Responses in the computing literature
- E.g., Japanese robots as a reflection on Shinto religion
- ‘Ubuntu’ is the name of a popular GNU/Linux distribution

## *1.3* Phenomenology and being


- Husserl
- Heidegger (I think we need to criticize Kant and the rational here)
- What is it to be alive?
- preontology
- be careful to connect this - being and everything - with ethics - Wittgenstein (ethics and aesthetics are one and the same)

## Responses in the computing literature
- TBA

# *4.0* Embodied cognition, social intelligence, collective intelligence 
- Helmholtz, Kant, Freud, Jung...
- contemporary cognitive science
- Peer Production, e.g., [Benkler, Shaw, and Hill](https://mako.cc/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf); Nissenbaum has a paper about peer production and ethics
- What is mind

## Responses in the computing literature
- “Computational Social Creativity”
- “Human-computer co-creativity”
- ==Say more about Anna’s paper here==
- I think Donna Haraway and other feminist thinkers would fit here
- Computational neuroscience: the ‘neural’ paradigm
- “How AI can be a force for good” — distributed agency

# *5.0* Reprise: Evolution regarding all of these 
- Histories of the evolution of intelligence (sociality & tools being key focal points)
- Theories of evolution, e.g., Baldwin (and later derived work by Hinton and others)
- Maybe survey what is common to all of them? and how do this constraints; maybe add cultural differences and analogies;
- Current research and breakthroughs on cognition and ethical selfawareness; metacognition and world philosophy; social learning of ethics
- Evolution of western thought - connections between philosophy and cognitive science.
- Simondon on technology
- [Bernard Stiegler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler#Books_in_English) --- philosophy of technics and other works
- [Peter Sloterdijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sloterdijk#Works_in_English_translation) --- philosophy of the human environment
- James Lovelock --- *Novacene: The coming age of hyperintelligence* --- This is good because of the evolutionary perspective, though his reasoning may be a bit off.

## Responses in the computing literature
- Evolutionary computing
- Metacognition and ethical judgement - (maybe connect to the title here, and bring cognitive psychology to the discussion (behaviour))
- Modelling ethics and cognition
-Untitled-1 Predictive Processing and Active Inference (bring embodiment to the discussion here)
- "Ethical AI": Notice that now that computers are involved, the way we think about ethics and so on is likely to change.

# Discussion

Have we learned anything that's relevant for practice? Maybe here is a good time to return to some of the debates that look at "creativity" in a more mainstream sense, e.g., Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneidermanabout creative systems and social inclusion vs  exclusion? From the point of view of "Methods", hopefully we will have clarified at the start why we think this sort of activity could lead to new insights!

## Illustrations — Examples back to them if introduced earlier

If we have a taxonomy we can see how it applies in a few cases!

We can comment on, e.g.. *Mathematical creativity* and *Logseq and
friends* (Zettlekasten method and second brains), maybe also *Computational Creativity*.

- use MC as an example on the ethical baggage - ACM community - creativity as AN/1 example
- Machines Who Think: A Personal Inquiry into the History and Prospects of Artificial Intelligence
- Ben Goetzel: 2 mindsets? AGI, Computational Neuroscience
- Luis: program a bot that can teach me math / Nic FFT equation; process philosophy as a generalisation of this?

### Mathematical Creativity / Mathematics and computing...

They say that Gauss was the last person who knew all of mathematics.

- David Hume on the problem of induction

Have we built up enough of a repertoire to do a deep dive on
mathematical creativity?  Do we need to address these points at the
outset?

- What is mathematics? martin heidegger anything learnable as such. Jorge Luís Borges - the map argument;
- The end of cognition and human ability? The limits of reality and the limits of math (e.g. dimensionality)
- Mathematical creativity as an example - and so what in what ways does it actually ramifies

S. Dick\'s paper talks about the role of hybrid systems, which has come
up again in Chess and will likely be prevalent in other fields:

> the character and capacities of computer work and human work depend on
> the nature of human--computer interactions and their mutual enabling
> and/or inhibiting in specific systems.

She talks about a "cultural materialism" in science.

> As will be discussed at length in the next section, one way that
> intuition was imparted to the computer program was as a weighting
> mechanism for privileging certain inference paths over others

Here's how she thinks about AURA in particular

> AURA was not merely a receptacle of prenegotiated social practices
> but, rather, surprised and resisted its users, participating in the
> negotiations that precipitated a change in mathematical thinking and
> problem solving. I hope that historians of mathematics will continue
> to investigate more instances of such negotiation.

### Logseq and friends??

Logseq is part of a history of tool evolution that includes Roam
Research, which has been massively capitalized recently

1.  Other relevant tools in the same space include **Org Roam** (FLOSS)

2.  Logseq itself is also FLOSS

The software is linked with a pseudo-ethical method:
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

I previously worked on a paper in this space: Massively 
buted authorship of academic papers

> Tomlinson, B., Ross, J., André, P., et al. 2012. Massively distributed authorship of academic papers. CHI'12 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, ACM, 11--20.

### Related work

Existing books like **1** about "creativity and ethics" and "technology and virtues" don't quite cut the mustard. Don't relate to our ethical framework in (1, 2, 3, 4, x). 

1. "Creativity and Ethics"
2. "Technology and the virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting"
3. "Made by Humans"
4. "Machines that Think"
5. How AI can be a force for good

#### Floridi

> ethical frameworks address individual, human responsibility, with the

> intentions of an individual. They were not developed to deal with
> distributed responsibility.

This seems like an important point: we'll need new (not necessarily
"agential") ways to think about ethics.  It seems useful to apply this
in somewhat more general terms about "intelligent systems" --- or just
"systems with emergent properties"; so, if distributed agents produce
e.g., environmental degradation, that’s not ethical, and the system
as a whole "should" find ways to improve its behaviour. This sort of
thing is thought about in Elinor Ostrom’s economics.

A particular concern of Taddeo & Floridi here seems to be "autonomy"
of AI, and "self-determination" of humans. But in the case of HCI/HCCC
it\'s not totally clear that either of these criteria apply. In HCCC
it\'s much closer to
[anthropotechnics](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2015/09/peter-sloterdijk-anthropotechnics/).

> Humanity learned this lesson the hard way when it did not regulate the
> impact of the industrial revolution on labor forces, and also when it
> recognized too late the environmental impact of massive
> industrialization and global consumerism.

I think it\'s worthwhile to think of these things as **not separate**
from AI issues [Supplementary info](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2018/08/22/361.6404.751.DC1).

Now, at the end, we might draw some conclusions about how "HCI" allows
us to do global research, build projects involving people from around
the world, with rich access to the world's knowledge resources. We
might also have something to say about why Ethical AI is so trendy
right now, and perhaps even speculate a bit about its future!

# Conclusions
Hopefully we can answer these questions:

1. **How can I practically engage with these issues as a computer science researcher?**
- - as a researcher how can I fit inside an ethical framework without disrupting my day-to-day way of work, that in itself guides me as a railway. 
- - how can this ethical framework overcome me as a CS male white european guy and still work for me as a CS male white european guy
2. **Tech design and CS thinking: creativity as mirror of ethical principles?**
- - creativity as one of the possible considerations to take towards something *I* do inside the framework
6. **Research Ethics, Practitioner Ethics, relating to other forms of Professional Ethics**
7. **Interfaces and establishing relationships between people and things?**
8. **How do I relate to knowledge, and with/to the whole body of historical philosophy, science, inquiry, and maybe AI and tech systems?**
