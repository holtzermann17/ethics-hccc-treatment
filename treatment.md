# HCCC Ethics paper treatment

The aim of this paper to re-imagine “Human Computer Interaction” as a
co-evolutionary process.  We address this through a detailed
reconsideration of the concepts “creativity” and “ethics”.  The
motivation for the investigation is that ethics also hard for humans
to get right — e.g., consider ongoing concerns about climate change,
genocides, etc. — so, accordingly, it becomes relevant to consider
computational ethics not just in terms abstractions like trolley
problems, but within a concrete historical context.  Similarly, we are
led to look at “creativity” not in terms of an auteur — or even
necessarily a single agent, but in terms of systems interaction.  By
bringing together philosophical and computing literature, we hope to
develop a set of salient ethical guidelines for researchers and
practitioners in computing fields.

Introduction 
============

Terms of engagement
-------------------

### We re-imagine "Human Computer Interaction" as a co-evolutionary process that has been developing over long time spans.

There\'s nothing too shocking about that, but it can be hard to express
in words. One of the problems is "what do we mean by computer?" There
have been plenty of previous attempts to define 'human'!

### A motivation

'Ethics' is pretty hard for humans to get right (e.g., consider climate
change, genocides, etc.). We might hope that computational tools could
help. So, we consider 'computational ethics' not just in terms of
abstractions like trolley problems, but with an eye to concrete
applications within in 'hybrid' systems.

*Premises* --- *'Human-computer interaction' is a bigger deal than we might think at first glance!...*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Scope* --- TOCHI --- *covers humans interacting with computers* 
------------

Our RQ: WHAT ARE SUITABLE ETHICS FOR HCI?

*Approach* --- *We will survey philosophy and its applications in CS; then, we will describe possible next steps for research.*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approach {#approach tag="HL"}
========

Main idea survey philosophical ideas that are relevant and look at how they are used in practice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One source: HCCC

-   *Human-computer cocreativity* (HCCC) is a motivating domain
-   In HCCC, creativity is attributed to collectives
-   But, now we want to think of 'creativity' in broader historical
    terms
-   We want to think about how humans have 'created themselves' or
    rather *co-created themselves together with* computational media.

What are 'computational media'?

> \***Wikipedia**: A computer is a machine that can be instructed to
> carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically
> via computer programming.

> \***Wikipedia**: The term "computer", in use from the early 17th
> century (the first known written reference dates from 1613), meant
> "one who computes": a person performing mathematical calculations,
> before electronic computers became commercially available. Alan Turing
> described the "human computer" as someone who is "supposed to be
> following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any
> detail."

Intuition: What is a proof?

> "Intuitively, given a formal statement $z$ (for example, "this graph
> admits a proper 3-coloring"), a proof $π$ for $z$ is information that
> enables one to check the validity of $z$ more efficiently than without
> access to the proof (in this example, $π$ could be an explicit
> assignment of colors to each vertex of the graph)." ---
> $\mathsf{MIP}^*
> = \mathsf{RE}$

### An inspiring writing model: "Peer Production: A Form of Collective Intelligence" (Benkler et al.)

> In the rest of this chapter, we describe the development of the
> academic literature on peer production and collective intelligence in
> three areas -- organization, motivation, and quality. In each area, we
> introduce **foundational work** consisting primarily of earlier
> scholarship that sought to describe peer production and establish its
> legitimacy. Subsequently, we characterize work, usually more recent,
> that seeks to pursue **new directions** and to derive more nuanced
> analytical insights. ---

Premises
--------

### We've entered into a new era, and we need to understand what's going on.

### Although part of this is the legacy of the industrial revolution, computers have played a significant role in the growth of knowledge

### In a certain sense the CS field is playing "catch-up" with CMC: we invent new paradigms for interaction (e.g., Wikipedia, machine learning)

### However, we don't yet have a robust way to *think* about human computer interaction at this broad scale

### We try to wrap our minds around "Human-Computer Co-Creativity" by looking at CMC, HCI, and CI.

Let's work our way up to discussing HCCC by starting with "human
co-creativity using computers", and introduce AI once we have a grasp of
how computer mediated communication and collective intelligence works.

Scope
-----

### TOCHI's statement of purpose

> ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI) covers the
> software, hardware and human aspects of interaction with computers.
> Topics include hardware and software architectures; interactive
> techniques, metaphors, and evaluation; user interface design
> processes; and users and groups of users. Those within the artificial
> intelligence, object-oriented systems, information systems, graphics
> and software engineering communities, will benefit from the high
> quality research papers in TOCHI concerning information and ideas
> directly related to the construction of effective human-computer
> interfaces.

### Our research question within this area:

1.  Is there an ethical use of computer technology, and if so, what is
    it? How would we get intuitions about that?

2.  What is our orientation towards computers broadly put?

3.  How can we bring a deeper foundation for the ethical use of
    intelligence technology?

Background: Concepts {#background-concepts-1 tag="HL"}
====================

> At this point our aim is to set up the framework for reviewers to
> evaluate the paper's contributions, not to dazzle them with esoteric
> concepts! Nevertheless some framing concepts can be helpful.

Philosophy:
-----------

-   "Creative evolution" from Bergson
-   "Anthropotechnics" from Sloterdijk.

Anthropology:
-------------

-   "Chaîne opératoire" from André Leroi-Gourhan et al.
-   Histories of the evolution of intelligence (sociality & tools being
    key focal points)

Computing
---------

-   "Computational Social Creativity" is one sub-field of computing
    research that is apropos, because it considers creativity spread
    across a social field.

Other fields:
-------------

-   "Professional ethics" (e.g., with reference to medicine, physics,
    etc).

Background: HCCC {#background-hccc-1 tag="HL"}
================

When we talk about Human-Computer Co-Creativity, what are we talking about?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want to establish the setting in which people can understand what
we're talking about.

### From Anna\'s [paper](https://research.aalto.fi/en/publications/five-cs-for-humancomputer-co-creativity-an-update-on-classical-cr):

> The new framework allows the attribution of creativity not only to
> individual creators but to a collective of creators, recognising the
> importance of meta-level communication to the creative collaboration,
> and the variety of creative contributions that emerge during a
> co-creative process. It also elaborates on the different communities
> and contexts surrounding co-creative collaboration and thus
> facilitates the analysis, evaluation and study of human--computer
> co-creativity by allowing researchers to describe and situate their
> work in the field.

Background: Other {#background-other-1 tag="HL"}
=================

Bergson's definition of "creativity" might be confusing for people, but it might be the the one we need to address our RQ.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/#CreaEvol>

Existing books about "creativity and ethics" and "technology and virtues" don't quite cut the mustard
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [TODO]{.todo .TODO} Say why these aren't sufficient answers to our questions {#say-why-these-arent-sufficient-answers-to-our-questions}

1.  "Creativity and Ethics"

2.  "Technology and the virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth
    wanting"

Survey introduction {#survey-introduction-1 tag="HL"}
===================

### Assuming we have the core concepts established, the survey section should be easy to write.

Basic plan: I imagine a call ("A") and response ("B") setup. The (A)
theme is to look at what people have said in various "philosophical"
traditions --- Western, nonwestern, phenomenological, experimental. The
(B) theme is to look at how these traditions have been received within
HCI and Computational Creativity research --- if at all. In other words,
this is a parallel survey of two different bodies of text, drawing
connections between them. While there could be a lot of reading here,
the writing part is basically procedural. Furthermore, we could break
down the tasks in different sub-sections to make it more focused. One
nice model for this structure of writing is [Benkler, Shaw, and
Hill](https://mako.cc/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf) Some
methodological questions we can ask about the computing papers: do the
papers consider ethics at all? Have they sought ethics approval? Is
ethics considered in only an immediate sense (like in a psychology
experiment) or in a broader sense (e.g., free software)? We could also
look at critical literature (e.g., dealing with AI bias). At the end of
this section, we should understand the different extant practical
approaches to ethics, and how they're grounded in philosophy. We can use
boundary lines like "HCI" and "co-creativity" as selection criteria to
make sure that we don't include everything.

### *Main References*

### Based on what\'s raised in §1, create a taxonomic framework for the rest of the paper

This subsection should correspond to the conclusion of this section and
connect all of these to subsequent \*.B

### Western philosophy and ethics summary *1.A*

### How do people talk about mainstream ethics in CS? *1.B*

1.A
---

### Aristotelian vs Platonic

### Kant and the categorical imperative

### David Hume on the problem of induction

### Maybe talk about the authors that break down cognitivism and agree or not - dualists, functionalists, materialists etc

### All of this connects to philosophy of mind. Maybe necessary?

### go deep maybe into pre-aristotle

1.B

Need to establish keywords from 1.A to search the literature with!

At this level one broadly relevant category is "law"

1.  And, in particular, one sub-category is

2.0

### Survey of (relevant) non-western philosophies and ethics *2.A*

### Survey of related non-western thought (e.g., **decolonial approaches** to AI) *2.B*

2.A
---

### panpsychism, buddhism, animism, ubuntu

(all universe is alive and updating materialism) - which not necessarily
might be eastern but bridge with what doesnt exist

2.B

What\'s called decolonial AI, looking at international thinking about
this --- antiwestern in a way.

### Phenomenology and related philosophies *3.A*

### CS/ethics related to phenomenology *3.B*

### husserl and heidegger all the way - what is it to be alive.

May not be necessary to go into this - and on next chapter computational
neuroscience vs all these philosophical questions might be a problem.)

### preontology - and going to what he breaks down

### be careful to connect this - being and everything - with ethics - Wittgenstein (ethics and aesthetics are one and the same)

3.B

TBA

4.0

It seems that philosophy has become physicalized in psychology
(Helmholtz, Kant, Freud, Jung), leading up to contemporary cognitive
science.

### Philosophy of Cog Sci and friends *4.A*

### HCCC Ethics of Cog Sci and friends *4.B*

4.A
---

### Metacognition and ethical judgement - (maybe connect to the title here, and bring cognitive psychology to the discussion (behaviour))

### Modelling ethics and cognition

### Predictive Processing and Active Inference (bring embodiment to the discussion here)

### "Ethical AI"

mind
----

What does mind mean?

What is mind

4.B
---

Here we look at the CS literature that incorporates an ethics related to
"Cog Sci and friends".

### This seems to relate to the topics discussed in *How AI can be a force for good*

In particular, the part about "distributed agency" seems like a cog-sci
related topic.

5.0
---

Talking about human, cognitive, cultural evolution regarding all of
these positions.

### Maybe survey what is common to all of them? and how do this constraints; maybe add cultural differences and analogies;

### Current research and breakthroughs on cognition and ethical selfawareness; metacognition and world philosophy;

### Evolution of western thought - connections between philosophy and cognitive science.

Set up a launching pad for thinking about next steps beyond the survey.

### Notice that now that computers are involved, the way we think about ethics and so on is likely to change.

Case studies {#case-studies tag="HL"}
============

### Assuming we hold on to this section, it allows us a deeper dive into some examples. Case studies would allow us to look at the concepts we\'ve discussed in the previous sections in a real-world context. However, we'd want to be sure that these aren't just "tacked on." Possible examples:

1.  Maybe robots?

2.  *Mathematical creativity* throughout time

3.  Social machines

4.  *Logseq and friends* --- This could be a good one because it relates
    to the primary tool that we\'re using for writing this paper

Machines Who Think: A Personal Inquiry into the History and Prospects of Artificial Intelligence
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a book about AI. It relates to the *Case studies*, insofar as it
came up in a footnote in Stephanie Dick\'s "AfterMath". Notes below are
on that paper, not the one named above!

S. Dick\'s paper talks about the role of hybrid systems, which has come
up again in Chess and will likely be prevalent in other fields:

> the character and capacities of computer work and human work depend on
> the nature of human--computer interactions and their mutual enabling
> and/or inhibiting in specific systems.

She talks about a "cultural materialism" in science.

> As will be discussed at length in the next section, one way that
> intuition was imparted to the computer program was as a weighting
> mechanism for privileging certain inference paths over others

Here's how she thinks about AURA in particular

> AURA was not merely a receptacle of prenegotiated social practices
> but, rather, surprised and resisted its users, participating in the
> negotiations that precipitated a change in mathematical thinking and
> problem solving. I hope that historians of mathematics will continue
> to investigate more instances of such negotiation.

Logseq and friends
------------------

Logseq is part of a history of tool evolution that includes Roam
Research, which has been massively capitalized recently

1.  Other relevant tools in the same space include **Org Roam** (FLOSS)

2.  Logseq itself is also FLOSS

The software is linked with a pseudo-ethical method: zettelkasten

I previously worked on a paper in this space: Massively distributed
authorship of academic papers

Tomlinson, B., Ross, J., André, P., et al. 2012. Massively distributed
authorship of academic papers. CHI'12 Extended Abstracts on Human
Factors in Computing Systems, ACM, 11--20.

How AI can be a force for good
------------------------------

### Distributed agency

> With distributed agency comes distributed responsibility. Existing
> ethical frameworks address individual, human responsibility, with the
> goal of allocating punishment or reward based on the actions and
> intentions of an individual. They were not developed to deal with
> distributed responsibility.

1.  <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/13bwMQfn8RY67-znVdnC7WO6OdcpDtR83>

2.  This seems like an important point: we\'ll need new (not necessarily
    "agential") ways to think about ethics.

3.  It seems useful to apply this in somewhat more general terms about
    "intelligent systems" --- or just "systems with emergent
    properties"; so, if distributed agents produce e.g., environmental
    degradation, that\'s not ethical, and the system as a whole "should"
    find ways to improve its behaviour. This sort of thing is thought
    about in Elinor Ostrom\'s economics.

4.  A particular concern of Taddeo & Floridi here seems to be "autonomy"
    of AI, and "self-determination" of humans. But in the case of
    HCI/HCCC it\'s not totally clear that either of these criteria
    apply. In HCCC it\'s much closer to anthropotechnics

### Regulation

> Humanity learned this lesson the hard way when it did not regulate the
> impact of the industrial revolution on labor forces, and also when it
> recognized too late the environmental impact of massive
> industrialization and global consumerism.

1.  I think it\'s worthwhile to think of these things as **not
    separate** from AI issues

Mathematical creativity
-----------------------

### Section introduction: Objectives

Have we built up enough of a repertoire to do a deep dive on
mathematical creativity?

### What is mathematics? martin heidegger anything learnable as such. Jorge Luís Borges - the map argument;

### The end of cognition and human ability? The limits of reality and the limits of math (e.g. dimensionality)

### Mathematical creativity as an example - and so what in what ways does it actually ramifies

Discussion {#discussion tag="HL"}
==========

### The Discussion is a bit hard to chart in advance, but roughly it asks: having done this survey, and looked at a couple case studies, have we learned anything that\'s relevant for practice? Maybe here is a good time to return to some of the debates that look at "creativity" in a more mainstream sense, e.g., Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneiderman about creative systems and social inclusion vs exclusion? From the point of view of "Methods", hopefully we will have clarified at the start why we think this sort of activity could lead to new insights! Now, at the end, we might draw some conclusions about how "HCI" allows us to do global research, build projects involving people from around the world, with rich access to the world's knowledge resources. We might also have something to say about why Ethical AI is so trendy right now, and perhaps even speculate a bit about its future!

### Some possible places this could go:

1.  How can I practically engage with these issues as a computer science
    researcher?

2.  Tech design and CS thinking: creativity as mirror of ethical
    principles

3.  Research Ethics

4.  Interfaces and establishing relationships between people and things?

5.  How do I relate to knowledge, and with/to the whole body of
    historical philosophy, science, inquiry, and maybe AI and tech
    systems?
