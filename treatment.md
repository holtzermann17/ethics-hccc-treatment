Introduction
============

This article proposes an ethics of “Human Computer Interaction”. By bringing together philosophical sources and existing references to ethics in HCI, we aim to develop a set of salient ethical guidelines for researchers and practitioners. The development of such a project stems from 1) a need to cement the existing understanding of the use of computer technologies and 2) offer a position that can be used holistically in the use of intelligent systems as members of society.

Our motivation is that we've clearly entered into a new historical era, whether we think of it as the anthropocene, the information age, or indeed the Novacene (Lovelock).  Many of the historically-novel aspects of our current existence can be seen as the legacy of the industrial revolution: however computers have played a significant and increasing role since their introduction.  Whereas there are mature paradigms for interaction *using* computers (e.g., Wikipedia), the paradigms of interacting *with* computers (e.g., Cambridge Analytica) continue to raise problematic issues.  At the same time, there are many unsolved problems that humans together with computers are working to address (e.g., climate change)!  To ameliorate the harms and capitalise on the benefits, we need a way to understand human-computer interaction ‘at scale’.

We're going to say that **technology runs throughout**, but we're not going to theorize that in this paper; if you want to understand it, see Simondon, Heidegger, Steigler, et al.

## Questions
(1) How are ethics used and applied to contemporary information systems? (2) How do the systems 'react back' on my way of thinking about things? (2) And vice versa because of AI? How do they apply the ethics that I applied, or develop ethics of their own? What is lost in the middle? What would change, what could better? (3) What is the narrative? (You need a universal view to appreciate.)

Method
======

We survey references to philosophy within computing literature and references to computing within philosophy, focusing on ethics. Based on aligning this material we propose ethical guidelines - which in themselves present a worldview. The main contribution of this article is an ethical taxonomy that works for the future given the massive development of artificial intelligence and its pervasiveness. It will take into account: 1) the interfaces in which ethics can be applied (species and robots); 2) the change in behavior that comes from the 'benefit' to make people interconnected as a global mind; 3) until what point social interaction can change and *exist*; 4) reference and build on top of existing surveys on the topic (e.g. *Machine Implementations of Ethics*).

Scope
=====

*Human-computer cocreativity* (HCCC) is a motivating domain. In HCCC, creativity is attributed to collectives.  Here, we want to look in more detail at what what humans co-create computational media.  While our focus is on modern computing machinery, in order to cast a wide net we think about computers as ‘effective systems’, or even just as machinery.  Our survey will look both philosophical and computing work within the following thematic areas (*Why do we need this?*) **1)**  What should we understand by ‘an ethical use of computer technology’ (e.g. *slave/master paradigms*)? and **2** How can our reflections on HCI and HCCC build a foundation for the ethical uses of intelligence that work in the future?


# 1.0 Philosophical foundation for a contemporary ethical practice 
## 1.1 Western philosophy and ethics definition

Human beings have always been interested in categorizing their behaviour. Classification and criticism, personal and interpersonal, about actions taken towards the world. When this criticism is made, there is no way that it will not be realized subjectively (lens argument), even if it embraces generalization. This recursive feedback to outselves has allowed the analysis and assessment of actions that we deem meaningful - or that others consider significant in us - originating fundamental positions for human understanding from the human. It is not in vain that *ethics* derives from the Greek "ēthikós" (ἠθικός) that means "relating to one's character" - as a relational loop.

This behaviour multiplies. Just as I consider myself, I can imagine the way others consider me, consider them, and develop collaborative processes for all this. Right here comes ethics and the way it will happen in society. 

We stand on top of Paul and Elder (2003) and define ethics as: **a nondetermined set of concepts, principles and metarules that guide us in determining what behavior (acting towards) helps and/or harms sentient creatures.** Having a fundamental but abstract definition that allows us to develop ethics helps to create a relationship structure.

### 1.1.1 Responses in computing literature

These days, given the transmutation of information and increased reception of things around us, technology can even help us to revive and rethink the way these thoughts affect us culturally. For example the work of Kantosalo and Schneiderman: using computers to help us "think" about creativity. (Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneiderman (using computers to think about ‘creativity’))

## 1.3 Holistic views of philosophy 

Philosophy is inherent in the complexity and uniqueness of each culture. When applied from a broad point of view and not only focused on the human, it can conquer and integrate as its baggage other types of entities such as artificial intelligences or non-human organisms. As is the example of panpsychism (Seager 2006), where it is common to have a naturalistic account of the world, for
only from the point of view of some such account
can the issue of mind’s place within the natural
world arise. 

Even the philosophy of mind has in itself a position. Not only as a philosophy, but as a starting point for philosophy to begin. There is a beginning that points to a vision in which all the positions taken before that thought make sense. When using positions that are global in terms of beings that exist, an ethical framework forces us to consider computers as *creatures*.

### 1.3.1 Responses in the computing literature

Given the holistic point of view, which in itself is linked to space and context - the reflections made today often map the past. The way we relate - to each other, to artificial elements and the environment - is what has been driving us, we might want not only to map but also revisit past. 



# *4.0* Embodied cognition, social intelligence, collective intelligence 
- Helmholtz, Kant, Freud, Jung...
- contemporary cognitive science
- Peer Production, e.g., [Benkler, Shaw, and Hill](https://mako.cc/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf); Nissenbaum has a paper about peer production and ethics
- "What is mind?"

## Responses in the computing literature
- “Computational Social Creativity”
- “Human-computer co-creativity”
- ==Say more about Anna’s paper here==
- I think Donna Haraway and other feminist thinkers would fit here
- Computational neuroscience: the ‘neural’ paradigm
- “How AI can be a force for good” — distributed agency

# *5.0* Reprise: Evolution regarding all of these 

Histories of the evolution of intelligence (sociality & tools being key focal points). Theories of evolution, e.g., Baldwin (and later derived work by Hinton and others). Derrida's concept of [différance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff%C3%A9rance#Life_and_technics).

## Responses in the computing literature
- Evolutionary computing
- Metacognition and ethical judgement - (maybe connect to the title here, and bring cognitive psychology to the discussion (behaviour))
- Modelling ethics and cognition
-Untitled-1 Predictive Processing and Active Inference (bring embodiment to the discussion here)
- "Ethical AI": Notice that now that computers are involved, the way we think about ethics and so on is likely to change.

# Ethics Taxonomy

**Implementations in Machine Ethics: A Survey** provides a model. We will build on the proposed terminology: (1) Of ethical impact agents; (2) Implicit ethical agents; (3) Explicit ethical agents; (4) Fully ethical agents; (5) How are ethics really used in systems - that in itself (copy from #questions)

# Discussion

Have we learned anything that's relevant for practice? Maybe here is a good time to return to some of the debates that look at "creativity" in a more mainstream sense, e.g., Anna Kantosalo and Ben Schneidermanabout creative systems and social inclusion vs  exclusion? From the point of view of "Methods", hopefully we will have clarified at the start why we think this sort of activity could lead to new insights!

### Related work

Existing books like **1** about "creativity and ethics" and "technology and virtues" don't quite cut the mustard. Don't relate to our ethical framework in (1, 2, 3, 4, x). 

1. "Creativity and Ethics"
2. "Technology and the virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting"
3. "Made by Humans"
4. "Machines that Think"
5. How AI can be a force for good

This seems like an important point: we'll need new (not necessarily
"agential") ways to think about ethics.  It seems useful to apply this
in somewhat more general terms about "intelligent systems" --- or just
"systems with emergent properties"; so, if distributed agents produce
e.g., environmental degradation, that’s not ethical, and the system
as a whole "should" find ways to improve its behaviour. This sort of
thing is thought about in Elinor Ostrom’s economics.

A particular concern of Taddeo & Floridi here seems to be "autonomy"
of AI, and "self-determination" of humans. But in the case of HCI/HCCC
it\'s not totally clear that either of these criteria apply. In HCCC
it\'s much closer to
[anthropotechnics](https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2015/09/peter-sloterdijk-anthropotechnics/).

I think it\'s worthwhile to think of these things as **not separate**
from AI issues [Supplementary info](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2018/08/22/361.6404.751.DC1).

Now, at the end, we might draw some conclusions about how "HCI" allows
us to do global research, build projects involving people from around
the world, with rich access to the world's knowledge resources. We
might also have something to say about why Ethical AI is so trendy
right now, and perhaps even speculate a bit about its future!

# Conclusions
Hopefully we can answer these questions:

1. **How can I practically engage with these issues as a computer science researcher?**
- - as a researcher how can I fit inside an ethical framework without disrupting my day-to-day way of work, that in itself guides me as a railway. 
- - how can this ethical framework overcome me as a CS male white european guy and still work for me as a CS male white european guy
2. **Tech design and CS thinking: creativity as mirror of ethical principles?**
- - creativity as one of the possible considerations to take towards something *I* do inside the framework
6. **Research Ethics, Practitioner Ethics, relating to other forms of Professional Ethics**... maybe also at the governmental level ("There is also now a clear consensus that ethical AI is the only sustainable way forward. The time has come for the Government to move from deciding what the ethics are, to how to instil them in the development and deployment of AI systems."  — I'm not sure that's how ethics work -JC)
8. **Interfaces and establishing relationships between people and things?**
9. **How do I relate to knowledge, and with/to the whole body of historical philosophy, science, inquiry, and maybe AI and tech systems?**

# Future work

- GPT-3 doesn't understand anything about the world. OK; the work of **supervised grammar induction**, the meaning of the words... "The bat broke the window"
- How to approach the symbol of the word in context?
